## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/categories/1834.png">


* The data is a House Prices data set that has the price column as our target and 19 other columns as the features.

* I am supposed to use various regressions to build models and select the best predictive model based on the metrics such as R Squared and Root Mean Squared Error.

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab as our primary work environment.
